# [JungleMath] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Zist]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Shwetha K C] - [GCE Kannur]
- Member 2: [Parthiv Ajith] - [GCE Kannur]
- Member 3: [Geethu Krishnan] - [GCE Kannur]

### Project Description
[ We have made a fun ! calculator.Which instead of showing the correct answer it gives an alphabet whose possition in the alphabets series will be equal to the orginal answer of the arithmetic operation .Along with  showing an animal image starting with that same letter. For example for "2+2" the answer shown will be" D" with the image of" Dog ".Along with fun fact about the animal.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[There is an unique camaraderie between the numbers and the animals in our planet.Which needs to be found out .This is where the JungleMath comes to the solution,We set the relation between them and reflex out a unique fact  about the animal.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[This works  just like a normal calculatortwhere the answer is the position of a letter in the alphabet ie if the answer is "1" ,"A" is shown as the answer with a pop up image of a cute "ANT "along with the fun fact about that animal.  ]

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- [Python]
- [VS code]

In this image we use the arithmetic opeartion addition such that '9+1'gives the alphabet 'J' which is the 10 th alphabet in alphabetic series ,along with the 'Jaguar'image is shown and  its funfact.




![MULTIPICATION](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69ae5e4b-68f3-4ba3-938f-c4764483a7a0)
In this image we use the arithmetic opeartion mutiplication such that '13*2'gives the alphabet 'Z' which is the 10 th alphabet in alphabetic series ,along with the 'Zebra'image is shown and  its funfact.

![DIVISION](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/feb20477-fa86-42bb-8445-0cf74e357a4b)
In this image we use the arithmetic opeartion divison  such that '10//2'gives the alphabet 'E' which is the 10 th alphabet in alphabetic series ,along with the 'Elephant'image is shown and  its funfact.
